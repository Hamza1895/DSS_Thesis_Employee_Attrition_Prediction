## Abstract
This thesis compares traditional machine learning models and advanced deep learning models, particularly TabNet and TabTransformer, to predict employee attrition. It evaluates data augmentation techniques like SMOTE and interpretability tools such as SHAP to provide actionable insights. The study finds TabNet to outperform other models, demonstrating the potential of specialized tabular deep learning models in HR analytics.

## Features
- Benchmarking of traditional ML models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) against DL models (e.g., MLP, TabNet, TabTransformer).
- Implementation of data augmentation techniques like SMOTE, Borderline-SMOTE, and ADASYN.
- Interpretability analysis using SHAP to identify key factors affecting attrition.
- Integration of two HR-specific datasets for comparative analysis.
